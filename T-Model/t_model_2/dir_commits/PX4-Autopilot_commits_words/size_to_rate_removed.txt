6d8d8e3c88089f16cd59c4c70d35a06785a5dbfb MC gyro cutoffs - Reduce IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF to 30Hz and disable MC_DTERM_CUTOFF. A low gyro cutoff is needed for most medium/large size drones as the structural natural and blade-pass frequencies are low. A higher value is still desirable for small platforms surch as racers or well isolated autopilots and should be tuned by the user. Specific values for config files are untouched. The cutoff filter for the D term is disabled here as the required cutoff frequency for the default D term of the rate controller is higher than the gyro cutoff. In that case, enabling the D term cutoff would just add some undesired phase lag to the derivative.
